# Basics of Probability

Discussed in the class, problems an examples discussed about conditional probability, joint proability, Bayes criteria, P(A+B) when A and B are
dependent, mutually exclusive or independent events.

# Definition of discrete and continuous random variables, PMF, PDF, CDF

Already discussed in the class. Same is captured in random_var.md

# Random variables with some well-known PMF, PDF and CDF

Binomial, Poisson and Exponential distribution discussed in the class. Same is captured in the class.

## Basics of queuing theory 

Could not be discussed so far due to classes disruption for examinations. Given in random_var.md as a link to another pdf file.
Try to undertand Little' theoem which states a very obvious result that, if average service time of each entity is more than average
inter-arrival time of entities in the system (Both arrival and service being Poisson disributed), there is no stable state. stable
state is possible only when the reverse is true.
Next, understand the state and transition probabilities of the system, meaning of $\rho$ and other statistics including gamma density.
Remember the formulae as simple problems regarding those are normally asked.

## Normal (Gaussian) distribution and other related PDFs

Gaussian PDF, mean and variance. Gaussian CDF does not have a closed form analytical answer.
If interested, look into how Gaussian PMF is derived from Binomial PMF (proof need not be remembered - just the logics and reasons of 
approximations).
Rayleigh PDF as a case of conversion of independent gaussian rvs X and Y from Cartesian to Polar coordinates.
Chi-Square as a case when a random variable $Y$ is made from sum squares of iid gaussian rv's ${X_1}^2,{X_2}^2,\cdots {X_n}^2.
$Y$ follows a Chi-Square PDF. No need to rememer the derivations - remember how P value is computed with the help of Chi-Square CDF
(no bounded analytical expression but with table of values given). What does Chi-Square test signify.

Two more easy things I shall upload :
- formulae for computing mean and variance from different PMF and PDF.
- Linear regression of statstial data, and finding out correlation coefficients and Pearson's coefficient of linearity.
